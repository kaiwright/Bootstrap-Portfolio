# Bootstrap-Portfolio - Week 3 Challenge

## Description

The aim of this project was to make a new portfolio website to display my future projects as a web developer, using Bootstrap this time. This was done by linking to Bootstrap's stylesheet and using their documentation to enhance my designs. I used the Nav bar, Jumbotron and cards, as well as adapting some of their styling to change different elements much more quickly.
In this project, I got a lot more practice using Bootstrap and modifying it using CSS. 

## Installation
